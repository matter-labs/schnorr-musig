# Rust and Wasm Implementation of MuSig
This is a Rust implementation of [MuSig](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068.pdf) scheme. It also contains generated wasm code and a [typescript-example](https://github.com/matter-labs/schnorr-musig/blob/master/wasm/typescript-example/test/example.test.ts) which illustrates full multi-party signing flow. 

## MuSig 
MuSig is effectively a multi-signature and key-aggregation scheme based on Schnorr Signatures. It provides security in plain public key model.  For overview one can visit [article written by Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/en-musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures/).

### Protocol
In order to produce a valid joint signature, each party needs to follow following steps:

1. Signer receives all public keys `[X_1..X_n]` and stores aggregated public key `X'`.
2. Signer generates a randomly sampled secret scalar nonce `r` and stores his committed nonce `R_i = r路B` and returns his computed precommitment `H_Ri = Hash(R_i)`
4. Signer receives pre-commitments `[H_R1..H_Rn]` and reveals his commitment `R_i`.
5. Signer receives commitments `[R_1..R_n]` and reveals aggregated commitment `R` if all pre-commitments match with commitment.
6. Signer computes a Fiat-Shamir challenge scalar c using cryptographically secure RNG
and computes his signature share by blinding the private key `x_i` using the nonce and the challenge: `s_i = r_i + c路x_i`.
7. Signer receive signature shares `[s1..sn]` and computes aggregated signature if all signature shares are valid.
8. Verifier checks the relation: `s路B  ==  R + c路X'` where `B` is group generator.

## Rust

### Definitions

#### MuSigSigner

` struct MuSigSigner`  Holds signer related private fields and implement functions for MPC steps.

#### Functions

- `MuSigSigner::new(..) -> Result<Self, MusigError>` instantiates MuSigSigner object.
- `MuSigSigner::compute_precommitment(&mut self, rng: &mut impl Rng) -> Result<Vec<u8>, MusigError>` Pre-commitment is hash of serialized point which computed by multiplication of a randomly generated scalar with generator. rng must be a cryptographically secure one.
- `MuSigSigner::receive_precommitments(&mut self, pre_commitments: &[Vec<u8>]) -> Result<Point<E, Unknown>, MusigError>` Receives pre-commitments of other parties and returns his revealed commitment which is a point in the group. These pre-commitments will be used to validate received revealed commitments in the next step.
- `MuSigSigner::receive_commitments(&mut self, commitments: &[Point<E, Unknown>]) -> Result<Point<E, Unknown>, MusigError>`  Receives revealed commitments and compare them against pre-commitments that received previous step. If all commitments are valid then returns computed aggregated commitment which is sum of all commitments. Each party must produce same aggregated.
 - `MuSigSigner::sign(&mut self, private_key: &PrivateKey<E>, message: &[u8], rescue_params: &<E as RescueEngine>::Params) -> Result<E::Fs, MusigError>` Computes signature share with a challenge 'c'
 - `MuSigSigner::receive_signatures(&self, signature_shares: &[E::Fs]) -> Result<Signature<E>, MusigError> ` Receives signature shares and verifies them. If all signature shares are valid then returns an aggregated signature. Each party must produce same aggregated signature.
- `MuSigSigner::receive_signatures(&self, signature_shares: &[E::Fs]) -> Result<Signature<E>, MusigError>` Receives signature shares and verifies them. If all signature shares are valid then returns an aggregated signature. Each party must produce same aggregated signature.

#### MuSigVerifier

` struct MuSigVerifier`  Implements verification functions

#### Functions

`MuSigVerifier::verify(message: &[u8], pubkeys: &[PublicKey<E>], signature: &Signature<E>, position: usize, jubjub_params: &<E as JubjubEngine>::Params, generator: FixedGenerators, rescue_params: &<E as RescueEngine>::Params) -> Result<bool, MusigError>` Verifies an aggregated signature according to its public keys.

### Tests
```
cargo test --lib -- --nocapture test_musig_multiparty_full_round
```


## WASM

It contains wasm code for MuSig. All functions same with Rust code but inputs need to be serialized.

### Build

```
cd wasm/
./build.sh
```
